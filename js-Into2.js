//Using Math.random(), console.log 3 random decimal numbers from 0 to 1000

//Using Math.random(), console.log 3 random whole numbers from 0 to 1000

//In your own words describe what "type coercion" in JavaScript is - this can be brief.

	//this is the process of converting or chaning one data type (example: integer) to another data type (example: string). This can happen automatically or if prompted to with indentifiers through the compiler or when the program is running.

  /*1. Temperature Converter Lab
     Objective: Create a program that can convert temperature from Fahrenheit, to Celsius, or Kelvin and back.  
        Instructions:
            1. Given a temperature in Fahrenheit write the code that converts Fahrenheit to its equivalent Celsius & Kelvin values
            2. Given a temperature in Celsius write the code that converts Celsius to its equivalent Fahrenheit & Kelvin values
            3. Given a temperature in Kelvin write the code that converts Kelvin to its equivalent Fahrenheit & Celsius values
                 Note: Conversion formula: http://www.csgnetwork.com/temp2conv.html.
                 Note: Sample temperatures: 32f = 0c = 273.15K.

  2. Create a variable and assign the string: "we are coders!",
      then In ONE LINE - extract the word "coder" and log it.

After completing push your file to github:
Make sure to add a link to your file as your hw submission!*/
