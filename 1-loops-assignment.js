// 1.   Declare a for loop that starts at 0, goes until 30, and increments by 1
//      Each loop it should log to the console 'the current index is _'

const countIndexMax = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30];

for(let i = 0; i < countIndexMax.length; i++){
  console.log(`the current index is _ ${countIndexMax[i]}`);
}

// 2.   Declare a for loop that starts at 1, goes until 10, and increments by 2
//      Each loop it should log to the console the current index

// 3.   Create an array with your top 5 celebrity names in it. 
//      Be sure each element is a first & last name, ex: ['Martha Stewart', 'David Beckham', ...]
//      Loop over the array and log each celebrity's full name to the console.

// 4.   Loop over your celebrity list and 
//      If a celebrity's full name has an even number of characters log it to the console

// 5.   Use the your celebrity array for this question
//      Create a for loop which will iterate over each element and output a new array of only first names

// 6.   Use the your celebrity array for this question
//      Create a for loop which will output two separate arrays, one with only initials, one with only last names

// 7.   Loop over the celebrity list and then loop through each name. 
//      If a letter is a vowel, log it to the console

// 8.   Loop over the celebrity list and then loop through each name. 
//      If a letter is uppercase, log it to the console

// 9.   Convert your celebrity array to all caps and no spaces:
//      Ex:
//        Input:  ['Martha Stewart', 'David Beckham', etc..] 
//        Output: ['MARTHA-STEWART', 'DAVID-BECKHAM', etc..]

// 10.  Index your array to find your favorite celebrity. 
//      Save that name to a variable
//      Loop over the array until you find that individual
//      Log that name to the console and break out of the loop

//BONUS:
//      Write a loop that iterates from zero until 30
//      If an index is divisible by 2 log 'fizz'
//      If an index is divisible by 3 log 'buzz'
//      If an index is divisible by both 2 & 3, log 'fizz-buzz'
//      Otherwise print the index to the console
